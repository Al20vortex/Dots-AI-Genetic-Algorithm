# Dots-AI-Genetic-Algorithm

Hi all,

This project was inspired by and mostly follows along with Code Bullet's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZfhUcNiqk where he makes some dots eventually
find their way to a goal using the Genetic Algorithm, but no neural network. Though simple, it was a valuable way to familiarize myself with AI as well as learn some Python.
Do whatever you want with the code. The next step should be a project that uses a basic neural network to learn.
