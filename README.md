# Dots-AI-Genetic-Algorithm

Hi all,

This project was inspired by Code Bullet's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZfhUcNiqk where he makes some dots eventually
find their way to a goal using the Genetic Algorithm, but no neural network. Though simple, this project was a valuable way to learn about genetic algorithms and a first step into AI. The next step should be a project that uses a basic neural network to learn.
